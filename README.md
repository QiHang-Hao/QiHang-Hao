## Welcome ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently working at Harbin Engineering University for a PhD.

My research uses the Discontinuous Galerkin method to simulate underwater blast shock waves and structural damage, and my ORCID is 0000-0001-8347-3636.

Most of the code is stored in private libraries (GitLab). If you are interested in the algorithms I use, please get in touch by the email in my profile.
